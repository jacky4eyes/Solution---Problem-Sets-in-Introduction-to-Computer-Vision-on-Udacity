## PS2

Disparity calculation
1. Using different window sizes
	- It is clear that the larger window size, the "smoother" the results, which is good for indication of main object  groups. However, the edges look distorted and some fine/small objects are missing.
	- By contrast, a small window size will indicated a lot more small objects and more defined edges, with the introduction of more "noises".
