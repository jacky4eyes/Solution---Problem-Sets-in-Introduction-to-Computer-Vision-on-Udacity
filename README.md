% Using different window sizes for D_L and D_R
% It is clear that the larger window size, the "smoother" the results,
% which is good for indication of main object groups. However, the edges
% look distorted and some fine/small objects are missing. By contrast, a
% small window size will indicated a lot more small objects and more
% defined edges, with the introduction of more "noises".
